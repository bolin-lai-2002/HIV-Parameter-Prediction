# HIV-Parameter-Prediction

## Abstract: 
AIDS, a global pandemic, primarily causes the rapid depletion of CD4+ T cells, leading to severe damage to the immune system and increased susceptibility to infections. In this project, we aim to estimate the parameter values of an ordinary differential equation model representing the interaction between HIV and CD4+ T cells. This estimation facilitates the assessment of the severity of the disease.
